# CalcTest

A calculator example app for playing with Test Driven Development

## Documentation

There is documentation in the code so you can understand what is going on. Also
the appldocs are available [here](http://jmburges.github.io/CalcTest/). You should
check them out if the code is confusing to you!

## Missing Features To Implement/Test

The Division and Subtraction features are currently missing on purpose. We will 
cover these in an upcoming [New York iOS Developer Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/new-york-ios-developer/events/157694312/).

Feel free to start playing with the code before the meetup though!
